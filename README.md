# Getting Started
This is a simple repository.
This repository is reserved for a LocalScript made for Roblox.

# How can I use this?
Execute the following code into an executor. Synpase X works best.

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("\104\116\116\112\115\58\47\47\114\97\119\46\103\105\116\104\117\98\117\115\101\114\99\111\110\116\101\110\116\46\99\111\109\47\73\114\102\97\110\97\110\100\99\97\116\115\47\99\97\116\46\112\114\111\103\114\97\109\109\105\110\103\47\109\97\105\110\47\112\105\118\111\116\46\108\117\97\10", true))()
```
Inside the executor tab, insert the Lua code.
